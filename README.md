# CodeIgniter 4 - Digital Ocean App Plataform

This repository contains an example application built with CodeIgniter 4, a popular PHP framework for building web applications. The application includes a simple "Welcome to CodeIgniter 4 Page" and a button that allows for easy deployment to DigitalOcean's App Platform.

DigitalOcean's App Platform is a fully managed platform that allows developers to deploy, manage, and scale their applications without worrying about infrastructure. With just a few clicks, developers can deploy their applications to the cloud and take advantage of features like automatic scaling, continuous deployment, and built-in security.

In this example, the deploy button makes use of DigitalOcean's App Platform GitHub integration to automatically deploy the application to the cloud. This makes it easy for developers to test and deploy their applications without having to manually configure servers or worry about deployment scripts.

Whether you're new to CodeIgniter 4 or just looking for a quick way to deploy your application to the cloud, this example repository is a great place to start. Simply fork the repository, make any necessary changes to the application, and click the deploy button to get started.
